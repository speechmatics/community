## Making suggestions

We love to get feedback on how you are using the current Speechmatics products and how they could be better, so please let us know anything that you think would make our products even better. Your suggestion doesn't have to be revolutionary - it could be something as simple as a wording change. We aim to foster collaboration between our product and engineering teams and the community, so if something gets identified for our roadmap, we'll feed back to let you know.

## A note on support

Please be aware that any help and support given within the public discussions is created by the community, and is not actively monitored or endorsed by the internal Speechmatics support team. Whilst we encourage community members to help each other, official Speechmatics support is provided only as part of a paid usage plan.
